CocoaHeads-MarvelWikiSample
===========================

This is the sample code used for a CocoaHeads Kalamazoo presentation on web services and basic graphics. In order for it to work, you must set up a developer API key/secret with the Marvel Developer Network (http://developer.marvel.com) and add it to the MarvelWiki/apiConfigSample.plist file, then change the name of the plist to apiConfig.plist.
